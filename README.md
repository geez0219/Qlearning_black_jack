# Qlearning_black_jack
This repository allows user to train a black jack strategy table (black jack AI) by using Q-learning algorithm 

# train model
'''
/Qlearning_black_jack#  python train_model.py
'''

This command will train the RL_agent to play black jack by playing 100000000 games, output the trained model to 'trained_RL.pkl' file, and plot the interactive strategy table.
